>This is  a simple **Todo list manager** that I have created as a practice project for FrontEnd technologies. It has basic three functionalities:-

1.**Adding a new Todo.**

2.**Removing a existing Todo.**

3.**Search/Filter the Todos.**

>I have created this solely for my practice purposes. Also it can help the people looking for a very simple ,minimilstic FrontEnd project,those who have not yet practiced CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap ,Tailwind or Javascript Libraries like React.

#### Note:-
>If you have any ideas to improve the project, feel free to clone it and let it be done in your way. Also this webpage is not intended to be responsive however it still works properly on mobile screens. For the best view I recommend to open in Google Chrome/MS Edge on screen size >13 inches. If you want to add Grid or Flexbox to make it responsive , you're most welcome to do so. For any queries email me at vedantupadhayay71@gmail.com
